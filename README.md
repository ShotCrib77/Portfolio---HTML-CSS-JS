<-- Design was not documented -->

Day 1 of coding: 
Got a lot completed. Got stuck on a couple of things such as the navbar hamburger menu not working at all... In the end It was all because I hadn't linked the JS document... 
Furthermore I struggled on getting the active-bar for the nav completed. Initially tried <span> but it was tough getting it aligned correctly, so far no responsivity issues. 
Wrapped up the day with a CSS quality check: 99 99 100. Too many Declarations in a single RuleSet and Avoid complex selector. Overall a quite productive day.
